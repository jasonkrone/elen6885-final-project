Transfer learning has been extremely sucessful in the computer vision domain.
The is exemplified by the fact that most state-of-the-art deep classification,
detection, and segmentation networks are first pre-trained on the imagenet dataset
and then fine tuned on the evaluation dataset. However, in the Reinforcement Learning domain
transfer learning has not exhibited the same success. Policies learned by agents
are not easily transferable to new similar tasks. In this work we benchmark
the performance of the two most sucessful existing policy transfer methods on
varients of the MuJoCo environment. In addition, we propose our own transfer learning
method, which IS REALLY REALLY COOL!
